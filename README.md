# Excel-Projects
A collection of Excel Sheets I created mostly for fun and because why not

1. Excel-Tris: A basic version of Tetris created using mostly Excel formulas, with just enough VBA to add movement.
2. Basic Sudoku Solver: A recursive sudoku solver that implements simple and complex logic.
3. Number to Word: A dumb little script that converts a number up to 12 digits into a number as a text string
